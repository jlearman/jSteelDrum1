## How-to

Click the green "Code" button above, and choose "Download ZIP". Unpack the .zip
file into a folder of your choice, and load the result into your sample player.  I use Sforzando,
which supports FLAC.  You only need the jSteelDrum-flac-sfz folder and its contents.
The .sfz file in there is what you load into your player.

## About the instrument

This is a sampling of a steel drum hand-made in Trinidad and sold by Hopetown Music of Long
Beach CA, around 2005.  (See photo & PDF.)  The samples were recorded in September 2021.

Samples were recorded in mid-side stereo using an AT4033a as the mid mic and a Studio Projects
B3 as the side mic.  I am not a percussionist let alone a steel drum player, so
the dynamics are less even than I would like.  I hope to re-record the samples (I'd say
50% chance of this happening) so stay tuned.

## Controls

Use the Mod wheel (CC1) to control stereo depth.  With the mod wheel in the center (50%),
the stereo depth is 100% (normal.)  Pull the wheel all the way down to get pure mono, or push above
50% to get an extra wide image, or anything in between.  When you load the sampleset,
the depth will be 100% even if the mod wheel is not at zero, but if you move the mod
wheel, the depth will change accordingly.

Enjoy!
